Free up some more hard drive space.


WARNING!! - It is strongly recommended that you close all applications
before installing Battlefield Vietnam.


==================================================================
Installing DirectX
==================================================================

If you declined to install DirectX when initially installing
Battlefield Vietnam, the latest version of DirectX can be downloaded from: 
www.microsoft.com\directx

Previous versions of DirectX are not fully supported.

==================================================================
Using your own MP3 music
==================================================================

In the start menu selections for Battlefield Vietnam, there is a
custom playlist folder.  If you place MP3 audio files into this
folder, those files will be used in place of the default game
music for the vehicle radios.

Note that the MP3 files are used on your machine only.  Everyone else
will hear the default music.  This is even the case if they share
the same songs as you.   

==================================================================
Improving Gameplay Performance
==================================================================

VIDEO SETTINGS

- Systems with 256MB of RAM should always run the game with 
  video and sound settings set to "LOW".

- From the Main Menu choose the "Options" menu. Then, select 
  the "Video" menu, select "Texture Quality" and experiment with 
  the slider in order to find the best setting for your computer. 
  You can also try lowering the "Graphics Quality" in order to
  optimize for your machine's level of performance.
 
- Also from the "Video" menu, uncheck the "SHADOWS" check box. 
  This will prevent the game from creating dynamic shadows for 
  soldiers and vehicles and can improve performance.

- Also from the "Video" menu, uncheck the "LIGHTMAPS" check box. 
  This will prevent the game from adding detailed shadows on the  
  buildings, which can improve your performance.

- Try reducing your video resolution to 640x480 in your "Video" 
  menu. The lower the resolution, the easier it is for your 
  computer to run the game.

- From the "Video" menu you can lower your color depth from 
  32 to 16 bit by picking your desired resolution with the color 
  depth of 16 (800x600x16).


GAMEPLAY SETTINGS

- Turning the NUMBER OF BOTS slider down will improve performance 
  in the single-player maps. Experiment with the setting which 
  best suits your computer.

IN GAME

- By always keeping your command interface hidden (toggle with F8)
  you can improve your performance while playing. This change
  will most be most noticeable on low end systems.
  

==================================================================
DEDICATED SERVER
==================================================================

We highly recommend Battlefield servers to be run on dedicated 
server platforms. Currently, the best performance is on a machine 
with the following specifications:

8-player
WinOS/933Mhz processor/256MB RAM/ADSL connection

16/32-player
WinOS/1.6Ghz processor/256MB RAM/T1 connection

64-player
WinOS/2Ghz processor/256MB RAM/T3 connection (You will need at 
least 4Mbit of bandwidth)


As always, if you can increase any of the above hardware, you will 
improve your overall gameplay experience.

------------------------------------------------------------------

The following functionality exists in the Dedicated Server

GENERAL:
- Server Name: set the name which will display in the in-game 
  browser window.
- Password: set a password to allow people to connect to your 
  server. NOTE: DO NOT USE ANY SPACES IN YOUR PASSWORD.
- Time Limit: Set the time limit for certain game-modes. In 
  CONQUEST ASSAULT if the timer reaches zero the defender will 
  win. In CONQUEST HEAD-ON if the timer reaches zero the side 
  with the most tickets will win.
- Max number of player: Set the maximum number of players you want 
  to allow on your server. NOTE: EXPERIMENT WITH LOWER SETTINGS 
  DEPENDING ON YOUR SERVER HARDWARE AND BANDWIDTH.
- Rounds per level: This determines how many rounds will be 
  played before the map ends.
- Welcome Message: Set important information here for people to 
  see as they join your server.
- Bandwidth Limit: Based on your bandwidth connection, set the 
  appropriate limit to the information to and from your server.
- Internet/Local: Select if you want to start an Internet or Local 
  Area server.
- Automatic Restart: In the event that the dedicated server shuts
  down, this feature will allow it restart automatically.

MAPS:
- Game Mode: Select the game mode you wish to host: CONQUEST, 
  EVOLUTION, CUSTOM COMBAT or COOP. NOTE: FOR COOP YOU 
  MUST SET THE AI AND CPU INFORMATION FROM THE IN-GAME SERVER.
- Map List: Select the maps you want to have in your server 
  rotation. 
  NOTE: Depending on your hardware and bandwidth you may be need 
  to set the max players lower to limit lag. If you have a high-
  end server with a bandwidth which allows 1MB or higher upload 
  you can experiment with setting the max number of players higher 
  than 32.

GAMEPLAY:
- Spawn Time: This sets the delay before the player can spawn.
- Start Delay: This sets the delay before players start each map.
- Ticket Ratio: This is used to change the number of tickets being used
  to be anywhere from 10% of the default to 1000%.  The game automatically
  scales the tickets based on the maximum number of players.
  100% equals 100 tickets for a team of 8 (16 player game).
  It would equal 200 tickets for a team of 16 (32 player game), and so on.
- Team Ratio: This sets the difference in number of players per team
  so that the teams are unbalanced.
- Friendly Fire on/off: Toggle whether Friendly Fire is on or off.
- Infantry: Set the percentage of damage a player would take if 
  shot by another teammate.
- Vehicles: Set the percentage of damage a player would take if 
  shot by another teammate who is in a vehicle.
- Infantry Splash: Set the percentage of damage a player would 
  take if a teammate exploded a bomb or grenade nearby.
- Vehicles Splash: Set the percentage of damage a player would 
  take if a teammate in a vehicle fired a shell or dropped a bomb 
  nearby.
- Projectile backfire: Set the percentage of mirror damage to a 
  player if he shoots another player on his team with any bullet 
  or shell.
- Explosion backfire: Set the percentage of mirror damage to 
  player if he explodes a grenade or bomb near another player
  on his team.

ADVANCED:
- Target nametags: Set the distance at which enemy nametags 
  appear.
- Friendly nametags: Set the distance at which friendly nametags 
  appear.
- Free spectator camera: Toggle this to allow the spectator 
  camera.
- External views: Toggle this to allow external 3rd person camera 
  views in vehicles.
- Nose Camera: Toggle this to allow players to turn off the cock-
  pit view while in airplanes.
- Autoswitch teams: Toggle this to have balanced numbers of 
  players per team according to current map.
- Punkbuster Enabled:  This will provide punkbuster protection. 

IP SETTINGS
NOTE: This functionality is to be used if you are running 
      Battlefield Vietnam on a dual-processor system. In order
      to make this work do the following:
      - Install the game as usual
      - Make a copy of the installed directory
      - Run one dedicated server from the original install
        and another dedicated server from the copy.
- Detect Automatically: check this if you want the game to 
  check for the IP automatically.
- IP Address: manually set the IP address you want the game to 
  use.
- Port: manually set the port you want the game to use.

CUSTOM COMBAT:
- Teams/Kits:  Use the drop down window to set the force for the blue team.
  This may be the default for the map or any of the other available forces.
  Note that you cannot have the same two forces facing off.  The kits and
  weapons that are checked are active for the team.  To deactivate a class,
  kit, or weapon slot check off the corresponding checkbox.  Each team has
  its own settings so be sure to check both sides before starting a server.
- Land:  All available land vehicles are listed here.  For each default 
  vehicle, there is a corresponding dropbox.  By selecting another vehicle
  in this box the selected vehicle will replace the default vehicle.

==================================================================
MISCELLANEOUS
==================================================================

SINGLE-PLAYER GAME
- Battlefield Vietnam will set your default number of bots in 
  singleplayer for best performance based on your hardware 
  configuration. If you have a recommended system (1.2 Ghz/512MB 
  RAM/64 MB video card) this should fall around 24 depending 
  on the map. Systems which meet the minimum requirement will 
  be under that, and systems above the recommended system 
  requirements will be above that. You can always adjust that 
  number if you desire prior to playing a map.

CLEAR KEY-BINDING
-  If you have mapped a key to a command in the Options section 
   you can clear it one of two ways:  1) You can map another key 
   to that command or 2) You can select that mapped key and press 
   the ESC to delete all keys bound to that command.

PLAYER LIST
- The in-game player list (TAB) will only show the first 20 
  players in each team on a map. If your score sets you as the 
  20+ player, your name will be displayed as the 20th player on 
  the list.

COMMAND INTERFACE SPAM
- When you use the command interface too many times in a row, which
  could be considered as spamming, your interface will be disabled 
  for a short while. 

YELLOW ICONS on MINIMAP
- When someone uses the command interface their icon will flash in 
  yellow on the minimap for a brief moment. This is to give you 
  quicker feedback on their location and thereby determine the importance of 
  that message for you.

WinXP ISSUES
- Fast-User Switching is not supported by Battlefield Vietnam.
- Limited User accounts are not supported by Battlefield Vietnam, you 
  must have administrator access to install or uninstall Battle-
  field Vietnam. If you are playing under a Limited User account, you 
  must use the Run as Administrator option.

==================================================================
Troubleshooting
==================================================================

VIDEO CARD DRIVERS
- It is highly recommended to go to your video card manufacturer's 
  website and download updated drivers for your card.

ATI 9800 PRO
- Battlefield does not support some of the hardware features of the
  ATI 9800. If you experience strange graphical anomalies with this card,
  exit Battlefield Vietnam and bring up the display properties on your desktop.
  Click on Settings -> Advanced -> 3D.  In the 3D settings for 
  Direct3D make sure the "Use custom settings" box is not checked.
  If it is, make sure the "Application Preference" checkboxes for
  anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering are turned on.

SOUND CARD DRIVERS
- It is highly recommended to go to your sound card manufacturer's 
  website and download updated drivers for your card.

==================================================================
Battlecraft Vietnam and Mod Development Tools
==================================================================

Battlecraft Vietnam is compatible with Windows ME. The Mod Development
Toolkit 2.0 is not compatible with Windows ME.

==================================================================
Other Issues
==================================================================

SOUND CARD
- Note that the game might not run if your system lacks a sound 
  card. Also, your soundcard must support DirectX 9.0b. This 
  differs depending on operating system.

GAME RESOLUTION
- Changing resolution might affect the quality of the fonts in the 
  menu. The game operates best with the default resolution of 
  800x600x32.

DESKTOP RESIZING
- Some systems may not resize the desktop upon exiting the game.
  The user can manually go into desktop properties and reset this.

KEYBOARD CONTROLS
- Some PC keyboards cannot recognize certain combinations of 3 or
  more simultaneously pressed keys. This is an inherent problem
  unrelated to Battlefield Vietnam.

EJECTING CD-ROM
- Do not eject the CD-rom while installing the game. This has 
  resulted in blue screen crashes on some systems.

CHANGING RESOLUTION WHEN HOSTING A GAME:
- When hosting a non dedicated server you should avoid changing
  your settings as some clients may get disconnected while the 
  changes are being set.
  
ALT-TAB
- Battlefield Vietnam does not support the Alt-Tab feature of Windows.

SPAWN HOLE TUNNELS
- The tunnel spawns have a delay at map start that will cause them to
  not appear for several seconds.  There is a known issue with the tunnel
  spawns not appearing on some clients even after this time has elapsed.
  This issue is cleared up at game restart.  To solve the problem
  immediately, the server must use the command admin.restartmap.
